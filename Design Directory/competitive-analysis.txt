Through researching similar projects to mine, I found that there are a lot of apps and websites which are designed to help you organize your life, such as Trello, NotePlan, and even Google apps such as Google Calendar. However, these apps don’t have the look or feel of a bullet journal. They don’t have an aesthetic/journal-like user interface, instead they just display a calendar, or a list of tasks which you can check off. Also, while there are a few websites which self-schedule your events for you given certain parameters (eg. Picktime), these sites don’t have the ability to keep a list of tasks. While there are some apps like Goodnotes or Notability, where you can draw in a digital bullet journal, this isn’t a standard format, so the user has to import a bullet journal template.
Overall, while there are existing projects which can schedule and organize events and draw in a digital journal, I couldn’t find one which combines all of these into one platform as my project would.
